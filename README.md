# TI-84 Crasher
This bug has most likely been discovered before, but I discovered it accidentally while trying to simply make an infinite loop and thought it was interesting enough to share. It causes the screen to glitch out and the calculator to become unresponsive. 

Tested on: 
 - TI-84 Plus CE Silver Edition (OS 5.3.0)
 - TI-84 Plus CE Python Edition

Precompiled version can be found in the project root. Compiled with TokenIDE.
